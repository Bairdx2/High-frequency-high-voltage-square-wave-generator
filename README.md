# High frequency low AC voltage sinewave generator using an h-bridge
H-bridges are normally used to drive motors forwards and backwards by reversing voltage polarity but using semiconductor h-bridges allows the use of PWM which gives control over motor speed as well. H-bridges can also be used to generate high frequency AC sinusoidal waves with careful manipulation of PWM signals and polarity switching.
